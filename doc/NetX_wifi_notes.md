# NetX Duo WiFi

# Introduction #
The example project demonstrates the functionalities of NetX Duo Wi-Fi Driver using Azure RTOS on Renesas RA MCUs using Renesas Silex UART Pmod. The project utilizes some functionalities of Wi-Fi Onchip Silex module which are not supported by NetX Duo. The user can either scan Wi-Fi networks or manually enter network credentials. After connecting, the EP performs DNS lookup and ping operations on the user entered URL or IP address. It also demonstrates TCP client socket communication by connecting to the user entered TCP server IP address and port number. Once connected, the user can send 'on' or 'off' commands to control the on-board LED. The LED state is displayed on the terminal, and acknowledgment messages are sent back to the server. Invalid commands do not affect the current LED state.

Please refer to the [Example Project Usage Guide](https://github.com/renesas/ra-fsp-examples/blob/master/example_projects/Example%20Project%20Usage%20Guide.pdf) for general information on example projects and [readme.txt](./readme.txt) for specifics of the operation.

## Verifying Operation ##
1. Set up the hardware connection properly mentioned in [Hardware Connections](#hardware-connections).
2. Import, generate, build, and download project to the RA board.
3. Open a serial terminal application (e.g., Tera Term) to view output, configure the settings as follows:

    * To make sure the received data shows properly, the user needs to set:
      * [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> [New-line] -> Select [Receive: CR] & [Transmit: CR].
    * To echo back characters typed in Tera Term, the user needs to enable it through:
      * [Setup] -> [Terminal...] -> Check [Local echo].
    * The configuration parameters of the serial port on the serial terminal application:
      * Port: The port is provided by the J-Link On-Board.
      * Speed: 115200
      * Data: 8 bit
      * Parity: none
      * Stop bits: 1 bit
      * Flow control: none

## The images below showcase the output ##
**The EP information:** 

![ep_information.jpg](images/ep_information.jpg "The EP information")

**Scan for Wi-Fi Access Points:**
* The user presses '1' to scan for Wi-Fi Access Points.

![list_wifi_ap_scan.jpg](images/list_wifi_ap_scan.jpg "List of Wi-Fi Access Points")

* Enter the Wi-Fi index and password for Wi-Fi connection.

![wifi_scan_connection.jpg](images/wifi_scan_connection.jpg "Wi-Fi connection")

**Enter Wi-Fi AP credentials manually:**

* The user can press '2' to enter Wi-Fi AP credentials manually. Then the user enters SSID and password for Wi-Fi connection. 

![wifi_manual.jpg](images/wifi_manual.jpg "Connect to Wi-Fi manually")

**Ping operation:** 

* The user enter IP address or URL to ping:

![ping_operation.jpg](images/ping_operation.jpg "Ping operation")

**Connection to TCP server:** 

* Validation of TCP server entered by the user and prompt for the user to enter valid port number:

![validate_tcp.jpg](images/validate_tcp.jpg "validate TCP server address and TCP Port prompt")

* Send message to server on connection and wait for server message:      

![server_status_message.jpg](images/server_status_message.jpg "Sending and Receive Server Message")

* The message from TCP server as "on" or "off" is sent and is displayed on terminal upon successful reception of valid message:  
(Here either "on" or "off" is considered as a valid message from TCP server as these perform same action on the user LED. Refer below images for Sokit tool images.)

## Steps for TCP server creation and connection ##

* Download and run Sokit application (Download link attached in **[Software](#Software)** Requirements section of this file). The application interface looks like below image.

![sokit_interface.jpg](images/sokit_interface.jpg "Sokit Interface")

* On Windows, to find the **TCP server IP address**, open **Command Prompt** and enter **ipconfig**, the **IPv4 Address** shown is the **TCP server IP address**. **And ensure that the TCP server and TCP client are on the same Wi-Fi network.**

![tcp_id_address.jpg](images/tcp_id_address.jpg "TCP server IP address")

* Once started sokit, in the **Server** tab configure the **Network Setup**. In the **TCP Addr** field, enter the PC's IPv4 address. And in **Port** field, enter the port number (Create TCP server and start listening on a free port and value greater than 10,000 is recommended.). After entering the details click on **TCP Listen** button in application as shown in below image.   

![sokit_init.jpg](images/sokit_init.jpg "Sokit Initialization")

* After successful connection to the TCP server, sokit application shows IP address and port number of the client under **Connections** section in sokit application with "Hello" message from client, as shown in image below.

![sokit_client_connect.jpg](images/sokit_client_connect.jpg "Sokit Client Connection")

* After successful establishment of connection between TCP Client application (which is the EP running in client mode) and TCP server, message transfer can be made from server to client select the client in connections window, enter 'on' or 'off' in buffer section (shown as Buf1, Buf2, Buf3 in image) of sokit, as shown in below image.

![sokit_on_off_msg.jpg](images/sokit_on_off_msg.jpg "Sokit Client Connection")

* For the application other message than "on" or "off" is considered invalid (Reception of message is shown in on terminal). Acknowledgement from connected client is sent to server on successful reception of "on" or "off" message. On sending "on", the user LED turns ON. On sending "off", the user LED turns OFF. No action is performed on reception of any other message string.

## Special Topics ##
### Running tips ###
* Presuming all necessary hardware connections done, users should connect their PC or laptop connected to the same Wi-Fi router AP. 
* On PC/laptop, the user needs to create TCP server and start listening at port which is free.
* TCP server on PC can be created using freely available tool sokit and using **[Steps for TCP server creation and connection](#steps_for_tcp_server_creation_and_connection)**.
* TCP server must be running before the application tries to connect otherwise TCP connection functionality will fail on running application. 
* Values sent from connected TCP server other than 'on' or 'off' will have no effect on LED.
* If the EP is not working in terms of network connection/IP, please re-check RA configuration property for pins and ensure that the TCP server is running before application starts.
